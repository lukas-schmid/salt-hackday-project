# Fridge-Shopping-Recipe App

This app was built during the `</salt>` Hackday.  
In this app, you can store your food in the section 'your fridge'.  
Then you can search for the best matching recipe results depending on the food, you have at home.  
Missing ingredients can be added to the shopping list.  
After shopping, the new food gets added to the fridge.  
From there you can search for new recipes with your new updated fridge.  
You can also save recipes for later.
